# Datasets:
1) All Covid
2) Post Vaccine

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

All_Covid <- read_csv("All_Covid.csv")

Post_Vaccine <- read_csv("Post_Vaccine.csv")

# All Covid Data
plotts.wge(All_Covid$new_cases_per_million)
plotts.wge(All_Covid$icu_patients_per_million)
plotts.wge(All_Covid$hosp_patients_per_million)
plotts.wge(All_Covid$new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million)
plotts.wge(All_Covid$new_deaths_per_million)

# Post Vaccine
plotts.wge(Post_Vaccine$new_cases_per_million)
plotts.wge(Post_Vaccine$icu_patients_per_million)
plotts.wge(Post_Vaccine$hosp_patients_per_million)
plotts.wge(Post_Vaccine$new_vaccinations_smoothed_per_million)
plotts.sample.wge(Post_Vaccine$new_deaths_per_million)

```

## Post Vaccine DataFrame: Analyze 'New Death Per Million' Timeseries plots 
## Pick p and q


```{r}
# Post Vaccine Data
plotts.sample.wge(Post_Vaccine$new_deaths_per_million)
dr_aic = aic.wge(Post_Vaccine$new_deaths_per_million)
factor.wge(dr_aic$phi) # freq peak at 0 and .1369
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
