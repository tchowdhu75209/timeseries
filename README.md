### Project Overview:**

Analyze  Covid-19 Death Rate(per day) and the influence of other factors- New cases per day, Vaccination Rates, number of hospitalizations and number of ICU patients per day. We will perform the following taks:
1) Performing Univariate analysis on 'New Deaths per million'.
2) Build ARIMA model.
3) Build the following models: We will first build models using only 'New Deaths per million' and 'New Vaccinations per million' and then will analyze all other variables as well. We will also analyse lagged variables. Models to be built: 
  i)Multivariate analysis 
  ii) VAR models
  iii) MLP models
  iv) ensemble models using any of the above 2 models
